          description: 'The property shiftTime defines the maximum allowed working time of a vehicle type. In case a break is defined for this particular vehicle type, the duration of the break should be added to the shiftTime. For instance, if a vehicle type has a shift of 8 hours and a 30 minutes break, the total shiftTime should be defined as 8 hours 30 minutes. The properties `start.time` and `end.time` on the VehicleShift define the lower and upper bounds of the time interval in which the vehicle''s shift must lie. Under no circumstances may a vehicle start working before `start.time` or finish working after `end.time`. The `start.time` and `end.time` can be imagined as the opening and closing times of a depot where the vehicle starts and ends its tour. `start.time` and `end.time` can override the defined `shiftTime`. That means, in case the time defined by the `shiftTime` property is longer than the time interval between `start.time` and `end.time` the maximum working time of the vehicle will be reduced and will not exceed that time interval.
